Brightness contol using Mediapipe


### [Project Code](https://github.com/Praveenk8051/cv-brightness-control) - (.py format)


### ***Description***


Identifying the shape and motion of hands can help in improving the user experience across a variety of technological domains and platforms. MediaPipe provides one such solution. It makes use of Machine Learning and detects upto 21 points. 

The application explore on the idea to control the brightness of the screen. The code track the hand and keeps monitoring the Manhattan distance between the index and thumb fingers. The output of this is interpolated and fed to corresponding brightness of the monitor. The whole application makes use of Python programming language, OpenCv and Tkinter to demonstrate the project. 

### ***Observations and Further Improvements***
The detection is State of the art. There are many other improvements that can be done. The data can be collected further to apply ML algorithms to analyse. Also, this can be extended to other panel functionalitites.

Below shows the working of the brightness controller
